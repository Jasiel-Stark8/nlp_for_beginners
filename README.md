# nlp_for_beginners
My AI Engineering internship brought me to this point
It's not about integrating APIs this time, we are understanding the core concepts of NLP, NN, and much more.
Just like how a Software Engineer has domain knowlege in:
- Frontend
- Backend
- DevOps
- SysAdmin
- Cloud
- Databases
- QA Testing etc... \
A complete AI engineer must have domain knowledge in (although not really a standard but this is my definition):
- Software Engineering
- Machine Learning
- Neural Networks
- Mathematics
- NLP (i guess this is a subset as well)

It's a fun road and grasping the concepts quickly!
I am using this beautiful palylist by [CodeBasics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-AG4-qZs1A&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuvuAXhYjV2lMEShq2UYSwX&pp=iAQB)
Highly recommended!
I will be using this to learn all things AI related together with Andrej Kaparthy's playlist, where he goes from 0 to Neural Blast in a few videos!
Learning fast and efficiently while storing concepts permanently is key!
